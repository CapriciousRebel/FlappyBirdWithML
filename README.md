# Flappy  Bird Game in Python with AI (Hobby Project)

This game was made using the "pygame" module. 
The AI was implemented using the "NEAT" module.
This was the first game I made in pygame, and also my first machine learning program.

I followed this youtube tutorial series to learn how to implement this : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lwGZWXz5Qgta_YNX3_vLS2

### To run this :

 1. clone this repository onto your system (ssh : `git clone git@github.com:CapriciousRebel/flappy-bird-python.git`, https : `git clone https://github.com/CapriciousRebel/flappy-bird-python.git`)
 2. `cd flappy-bird-python` 
 3. `python3 -m venv venv`
 4. `source venv/bin/activate`
 5. `pip install pygame`
 6. `pip install neat`
 7. `python3 game.py`
